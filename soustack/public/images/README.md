# Recipe Images

Store your recipe images in this folder.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames that match your recipe (e.g., `chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg`)
- Recommended image size: 800x600px or similar aspect ratio
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 2MB) for faster page loading
- Images will be automatically displayed at the top of recipe cards

## Usage

When adding a recipe image in the admin form, use the relative path:
- `images/your-image-name.jpg`

Or use an external URL if you prefer:
- `https://example.com/image.jpg`
