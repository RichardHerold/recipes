    "put the rolls of dough on top of the sugar/butter/pecans (4x3 rows) and sprinkle the top with cinnamon sugar. Let sit (you can cover it and see if that works faster) so the dough can rise to twice the original size",
    "bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until the dough is browned",
    "flip upside down onto foil immediately and put onto cooling rack"
