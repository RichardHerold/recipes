    "Cut the butter into large pieces and add it to a light colored pan over medium low flame.",
    "As soon as the butter starts to foam up add the sage leaves, (make sure they are dry) and cook together for 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "The butter will foam up and start turning brown (noisette). Do not touch it, and do not stir.",
    "The moment the foam subsides remove from heat. The sage should be crispy by now.",
    "Hit it with a squeeze of lemon juice if you prefer and serve it over cooked ravioli or gnocchi.",
    "Add the cooked ravioli to the butter sage sauce and gently toss to coat. When cooking the pasta make sure to reserve a little bit of the pasta water. Add a little bit of the reserved pasta water If needed to loosen up the sauce.",
    "Serve with freshly cracked black pepper on top."
