    "Tart Shell",
    "On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough to a 13-inch round.",
    "Gently roll the dough around your rolling pin, transfer to a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, and unroll.",
    "Gently press the dough down into the corner where the base meets the sides, and press the dough up the sides, leaving some above the rim.",
    "Pinch the dough to form a tidy, evenly thick rim.",
    "Line the dough with parchment paper or foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights.",
    "Bake until the dough is set and the rim is light brown, about 10 minutes.",
    "Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.",
    "Carefully remove the parchment and beans, return the tart shell to the oven, and cook until the base looks dry and is light gold, another 20 minutes.",
    "Let the crust cool slightly. (Leave the oven on.)",
    "Filling",
    "As the tart shell bakes: heat a small glug of olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.",
    "Add the pancetta and as soon as it sizzles, reduce the heat and cook until the fat has rendered and the pancetta is starting to brown, about 7 minutes",
    "Add the onion, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook gently until the onion becomes very soft and fragrant and is a rich golden brown, stirring and scraping the pan frequently, about 30 minutes.",
    "Cool the onion to room temperature.",
    "While the onion is cooling: Whisk together the egg yolk and cream in a bowl.",
    "Season lightly with salt and pepper.",
    "Fold in the Gruyère and onion.",
    "Fill the tart shell with the mixture, smoothing the top.",
    "Bake until the filling is just set, about 20 minutes.",
    "Let the tart cool to warm before cutting and serving."
