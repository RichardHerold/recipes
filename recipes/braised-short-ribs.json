  "instructions": [
    "Mise en Place:",
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.",
    "In a saucepan, heat the stock to a slow boil.",
    "Pat dry the ribs with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.",
    "Place the flour in a large bowl.",
    "Add the ribs and toss until the ribs are lightly coated in flour.",
    "In a large skillet, pour in canola oil until it reaches a depth of 1/2 inch; heat over a medium-high flame.",
    "Carefully add a few ribs at a time to the hot oil and turn to brown on all sides.",
    "Transfer the browned ribs to a large roasting pan.",
    "Continue until all the ribs are done.",
    "Discard the excess oil from the skillet.",
    "Return the skillet to the stove over medium-low heat and add the carrot, onion, and celery. Sauté the vegetables until they're lightly brown and transfer them to the roasting pan with the ribs.",
    "Add the red wine to the skillet.",
    "Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, stirring to deglaze the pan.",
    "Add the vinegar and brown sugar to the red wine.",
    "Stir until the sugar completely dissolves. Stir in the rosemary and hot pepper. Pour the mixture into the roasting pan with the ribs.",
    "Pour the hot stock into the roasting pan, submerging the ribs.",
    "Cover the roasting pan with foil and bake for 21/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily falls away from the bone.",
    "To serve, gently remove the ribs from the braising liquid and place on a serving plate (use a shallow bowl or plate with a raised rim). Ladle some of the braising sauce over the ribs and garnish with a fresh rosemary sprig. Serve with mashed potatoes and a sautéed green vegetable."
