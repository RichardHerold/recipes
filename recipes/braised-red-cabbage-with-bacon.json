    "Cabbage",
    "Slice cabbage in half lengthwise.",
    "Use a sharp knife to cut a V-shaped notch around the white core and discard it.",
    "Slice both pieces in half again so you have 4 quarters.",
    "Thinly slice each piece crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips and put in a medium bowl.",
    "Bacon",
    "Cut into lardons (about 1/4-by-1/4-by-3/4-inch pieces) and put them into a ramekin",
    "Onion",
    "Thinly slice the onion and put in a ramekin.",
    "Place bacon in a large Dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed pot with a tight fitting lid over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and most of the fat has rendered.",
    "Add onion and stir to coat in the bacon fat.",
    "Season the onions with salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "Cook until the onion softens and the edges begin to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.",
    "Add the reserved cabbage, stir to coat in bacon fat, and cook until the cabbage begins to wilt, about 4 minutes.",
    "Stir in the brown sugar and mustard.",
    "Deglaze the pan with the cider vinegar, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a spatula.",
    "Add the beef broth and season with a few pinches of salt and freshly ground pepper.",
    "Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low and cover the pan tightly.",
    "Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is soft and soupy and the bacon is tender, about 45 minutes. If the cabbage begins to look dry, add more broth or water."
