    "Mise en Place:",
    "Asparagus",
    "Snap off the woodier bottom inch or so of each asparagus stalk.",
    "If thick asparagus, use a vegetable peeler to shave away the tougher outer layer from each stalk.",
    "Line a plate with paper towels for draining the asparagus.",
    "Miso Butter",
    "Combine the miso with 5 tablespoons of the butter in a small bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until well mixed.",
    "Reserve until needed.",
    "Asparagus",
    "Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a wide skillet over medium high heat.",
    "When the butter sends up the first wisp of smoke, put the asparagus in the pan and cook until the asparagus start to take on some color, about  2-3 minutes.",
    "Season the asparagus with a generous pinch of salt and turn the heat down to medium.",
    "Turn the asparagus with a spatula or tongs and cool until they have color on the second side, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Transfer them to the plate with paper towels to drain.",
    "Season the cooked asparagus with another pinch of salt if needed.",
    "Miso Sauce",
    "While the asparagus are cooking, heat the sherry vinegar in a small saucepan over medium heat for 30 seconds.",
    "Add the miso butter, turn the heat to low, and stir to warm it through until the butter has loosened slightly.",
    "Remove the pan from the burner and put it in a warm spot.",
    "Smear a quarter of the warmed miso butter into a thickish puddle in the middle of each plate.",
    "Divide the asparagus among the plates and top each with an egg.",
    "Finish each dish with a few turns of black pepper, and serve at once."
