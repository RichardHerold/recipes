    "INSTANT POT:",
    "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse onion and garlic until roughly chopped, scraping bowl as necessary.",
    "Set your Instant Pot to Sauté and pour in the ghee. When lightly smoking, add onion/garlic mixture, berbere, and salt.",
    "Saute well until the mixture is fairly dry. Do not skip this step. Ideally, we would have made spiced ghee (niter kibbeh) but we didn't because today we are lazy (but I prefer to think of it as being \"efficient\"). This step allows the spices to lose their raw smell, to infuse the ghee with the spice flavors, and cook the onion down to a nice base for the beef.",
    "Put in the ground beef and smash until there are no lumps. Add in the diced tomatoes.",
    "Add half a cup of water, set pressure to high, and cook for 10 minutes. Allow it to Natural Pressure Release for 10 minutes.",

    "If you don't feel like making your own Berbere you can buy some off of Amazon HERE.",
    "Make sure you allow the ghee, onion/garlic mixture, berbere, and salt to saute until it is fairly dry. This is an important step in creating the proper flavor profile for this Ethiopian Beef Stew.",
    "This dish freezes quite well, and I think it tastes even better the next day, so don't be afraid to make an extra-large batch!"
