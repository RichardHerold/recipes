    "Immediately strain oil through a fine mesh strainer set in a heatproof bowl.",
    "Transfer drained shallots to paper towel-lined bowl and blot with more paper towels.",

    "Place breasts skin side-down in heavy-bottomed 12-inch non-stick or cast iron skillet and set over high heat until sizzling, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, moving and pressing breasts to ensure good contact between skin and pan until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook second side until barely covered, about 30 seconds. Transfer to paper towel-lined plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes.",
    "Slice breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch strips and serve, topping with fried shallots and Sichuan peppercorns."
